# Dean_System
This project builds a teacher-student system based on C++.
In the project of the course Computer Programming, I built an Educational Administration System based on Unix platform which had three major parts as following: initialization, teacher accounts and student accounts. For the initialization, you can sign up with your name, ID and the name of the course you teach. In the part for teachers, I achieved some basic functions such as checking or editing personal information, replying to the students’ messages, announcing notification for the courses, upload the exam scores. Besides, there are some other functions including setting a remind in a specified day and checking the previous messages from others, while these functions can also be used in the students’ part. Moreover, every time you login in the system,  it will display the time you lastly login in.  Last but not least, the most impressive part of this system is that it takes all the potential error into consideration.  For example,  you can cancel the exam score of a certain student if you find that you make a type error, which means that you do not need to do it all once again.  And you can select to go back to the last menu after you do some operations.  Given that this system do not have a UI and just based on the unix shell, it is a sizable project which consists of around 2000-lines code.
